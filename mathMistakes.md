# Key Points to Review

Combination / proability
Ex: 8 pick 4 when order don't matter

stats stuff
Ex: the area underneath a normal graph / normal curve 

congruent triangles

skewed to the left or right: mean VS median

formula for the difference of square  
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 and (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab+b^2

find midpoint of 2 points

study SIN COS TAN and traingle short cuts (propery of isoeltes, equilateral)

if twice as many employees work at the plant in Mexico as work at the plant in Pakistan Means 2 Pakis = Mexico

what does integers consists of? is 0,1,and -1 integers?

What does primes consits of? is 0,1,2 primes?

4 qraduents

learn how to calcualte compound interest / short cut equation

result of a sqaure root, the answer must be positive
Ex: sqrt(k) = x + 1, since x+1 on the right side is the answer of a squre root.
x + 1 >= 0 or else the solution fails.

同圆或等圆中，同弧或等弧所对的圆周角相等

0 is even number

### even and odd number properties
- 奇数 有 奇数个， 和 差 为奇数 
Ex: a+b+c+d+e （a c e are odd） 3 of them are odd 
their sum is odd
- 奇数 有 偶数个， 和 差 为偶数 
Ex:Ex: a+b+c+d+e （b d are odd） 2 of them are odd 
their sum is even
- odd - odd = even
- even - even = even
- even - odd = odd


### product of even and odd numbers
- all numbers r odd, product is odd
- as long as there is 1 or more even, sum is even

### other useful integer properties
- from odd number A to odd number B (including both end)'s the number of odd = ( (b-a)/2 )  + 1
- from even number A to even number B (including both end)'s the number of even = ( (b-a)/2 )  + 1
- the range of n consecutive odd or even integers = 2(n-1)
- from even number L downtown n even number, you would be at G = L+2(n-1)
- from odd number L downtown n odd number, you would be at G = L+2(n-1)
- if questions asks for things about consecutive odd / even numbers:   
set evens numbers to 2k-2, 2k, 2k+2, 2k+4, ...  
set odd numbers to 2k-3, 2k-1, 2k+1, 2k+3, ...

equilateral triangle area formula
- radical 3 / 4 * (a^2) 
- a is the side length

rhombus's 4 sides are equal.

study rhombus's area equation 
- given side and hieight, area = side * height
- given d1 and d2 which are directly across inside it, area = 1/2 * a * b
- given side and angles, area = s^2 sin angle

business annual interest rate equation

study the trick of divisible number such as 3, 9 

study interquartile range

what affects the standard deivation of a equation(only multiply and divide matters)

For any equation ax² + bx + c = 0 -  
Sum of the values of x = -b/a  
Product of the values of x = c/a  

quadratic formula

多边形内角和公式=(n-2)*180

三角形：外角=两个内角和
两边之和大于第三边， 两边之差小于第三边。
