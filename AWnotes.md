## Issue
1. Write the positive AND negative views
For cause and effect questions:
- does the reasoning behind it make sense?
- if the reasoning make sens, can we get the correct result?

For suggesting a way to solve problems:
- is the suggestion doable?
- if we implement the suggestion, is it going to cause contradictory or bad resultsï¼Ÿ
- is there exchangable or compromising plan?

For something is good/bad important/not:
- what's the standard we use to judge?
- do we need to adjust the standard?

For defineing a term problem:
- does the defination catch the source of the problem?
- can I provide a more fitting definition?

For fact/observation problem:
- can we make a contradticdory judgement from the same fact?
- can we provide example of a opposite fact?

tempalte
- intro
1. hook
2. shift to prompt
3. thesis
4. outline

- body paragraph
1. topic sentence: main idea of that paragraph
2. example: NO PERSONAL EXAMPLE.
3. development: explain how this idea connect back to thesis. Why it matters?

- conclusion
maybe we can add a counterpoint, but instantly shut down by supporting our own idea.
1. explain how this issue is complex and there's no easy answer.
2. wrap up


## Argument


Before writing, we need to find
1. conclusion
2. evidence
3. think of 3 or 2 unstated assumptions

make sure to follow the directions.

- intro 
1. rephrase main conclusion
2. identify author's evidence
3. thesis: follow direction of the question

- body paragraph
1. supporting idea: following directino of question format (topic sentence should be simplified and easy to understand IMPORTANT)
2. exmaple 1 (use maybe perhaps. Not to determine, leave room for hypothetical cases)
3. exmaple 2
4. effects of the conclusion if proven true

- conclusion
1. statement as of now is flawed
2. request more evidence
3. statement of how evidence would help argument evalute more effectively

### common flaws
- over generelization
- use things from past to compare present
- conclude one case would be representative for multiple cases.
- badly designed survey
- ignore the negative conseqeuence
- those we REPORTED can be broken down as lying, mistakes, and represent the portion who did not take the survey
