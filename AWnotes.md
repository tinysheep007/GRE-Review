## Issue
1. Write the positive AND negative views
For cause and effect questions:
- does the reasoning behind it make sense?
- if the reasoning make sens, can we get the correct result?

For suggesting a way to solve problems:
- is the suggestion doable?
- if we implement the suggestion, is it going to cause contradictory or bad resultsï¼Ÿ
- is there exchangable or compromising plan?

For something is good/bad important/not:
- what's the standard we use to judge?
- do we need to adjust the standard?

For defineing a term problem:
- does the defination catch the source of the problem?
- can I provide a more fitting definition?

For fact/observation problem:
- can we make a contradticdory judgement from the same fact?
- can we provide example of a opposite fact?
