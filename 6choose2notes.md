# 错因总结
- pay attention to what is the blank referring to! Is it a person or is it idea?

- look for contrasting words such as now VS earlier

- everyone has a angle MEANS everyone is selfish and concern only to themselves
somtimes, 1 options might seems really good, but there's no other similar meaning word to mathc it.

If cannot identity the strong logic, try look for the lines before the blank, not just after the blank.

not only... ,... 可能有递进关系
选的词要比前面的近义词更加 递进

read the sentence carefully, don't necglect certain words because they serves important roles to hinting you which logic is correct
Ex: I did not find the word "loner" useful, but then later there is "sociable". Now you can instantly see, we want opposite words

pay attention to words like NOT

don't choose the word sets just because you know their meaning more. It does not means other options are not valid.

don't skip words when reading sentence

Opposites
contemporary - old-fashioned

Don't forget to check if options would be contradictory to other parts of the sentence or options. Even if you have option in mind, still check possibility of others

reassure is positive word

charge somebody with doing something. 某人有责任做。，。。

or在并列否定句时，not是在or前后共用的，所以第一句话的完整内容应该是：consolidating memory is not instantaneous  or even  【not】 ___ ,
原句：
Consolidating a memory is not instantaneous or even _____: every memory must be encoded and moved from short-term to long-term storage, and some of these memories are, for whatever reason, more vividly imprinted than others.


### Verbal fill in blank overall

trust the logic of the sentence, don't use your own knowledge to judge the topic.

pick the words based on the context of the previous picked words as well

first, find the object where the blank is referring to. Next, learn the logic of the strcuture of the sentence: do we need to put a positive, or negative tone, or more severe tone.

as ... as .. 
it means two possible explanations and maybe they are the opposite of each other 

If there is logic expressing words, such as DIFEERENCE immediately pay attention to how it changes the flow of the logic.

... and ... is just parallel
don't overthink into more exaggrated
